Setups:
	Defect free simulation:
		- Must NOT trigger "fail" signal and remain at logic "0".
	Defect simulations:
		* Simulate the MCT testbench:
			- Violation of specs is detected if "fail" signal is triggered and changed from logic "0" to logic "1".
			- Violation of specs is undetected if "fail" signal is not triggered and remained at logic "0" until stop time.
		* Simulate the RAMP testbench:
			- Select only undetected defects by the MCT 
			- Violation of specs is detected if "testid" signal is triggered and changed from logic "0" to logic "1".
			- Violation of specs is undetected if "testid" signal is not triggered and remained at logic "0" until stop time.
			- In case of simulation failed due to any reason (convergence issue, simulation timeout, etc) defect is categorized as undetected.
