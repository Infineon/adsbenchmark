		This document introduces you to the schematic and the internal circuits of the delivered PLL. 
		The purpose is to enable the reader to understand, run and extend the test benches of this circuit.

		Testbench and cells netlist.

		Veriloga code that evaluates the bandgap
		Trigger "FAIL" signal if the circuit is out of specs
	% ref/defect_list.txt
		Potential defects list. 
		
Setups:
	Defect free simulation:
		- Must NOT trigger "FAIL" signal and remain at logic "0".
	Defect simulations:
		- Violation of specs is detected if "FAIL" signal is triggered and changed from logic "0" to logic "1".
		- Violation of specs is undetected if "FAIL" signal is not triggered and remained at logic "0" until stop time.
		- In case of simulation failed due to any reason (convergence issue, simulation timeout, etc) defect is categorized as undetected.
