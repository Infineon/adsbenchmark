Bandgap Circuit for the Evaluation of Analog Defect Simulation Tools

Content:
	% doc/readme
	% doc/bandgap.pdf
		This document introduces you to the schematic and the internal circuits of the delivered bandgap. 
		The purpose is to enable the reader to understand, run and extend the test benches of this circuit.
	% src/top.hsp
		testbench and simulation setup.
	% src/tb_bandgap.hsp
		Testbench and cells netlist.
	% src/model/*
		Models of devices used in the bandgap's netlist.
	% src/checker/bg_checker.va
		Veriloga code that evaluates the bandgap
		Trigger "fail" signal if the circuit is out of specs
		Set "testnr" to indicate which test violated the specs
	% ref/defect_list.txt
		Potential defects list. 
		
Setups:
	Defect free simulation:
		- Must NOT trigger "fail" signal and remain at logic "0".
	Defect simulations:
		- Violation of specs is detected if "fail" signal is triggered and changed from logic "0" to logic "1".
		- Violation of specs is undetected if "fail" signal is not triggered and remained at logic "0" until stop time.
		- In case of simulation failed due to any reason (convergence issue, simulation timeout, etc) defect is categorized as undetected.
